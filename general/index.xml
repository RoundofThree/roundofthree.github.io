      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote for my personal blog. Last year, while I was in 2nd year of Bachelor, I wrote more articles about Data Structures and Algorithms, and little things I found to be fancy about pentesting. After a year of self teaching and research, I&amp;rsquo;m now focusing more on reverse engineering, malware analysis and using data science for faster analysis. There are so many things that I want to know better, but I struggle because they are undocumented, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to retake this.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote for my personal blog. Last year, while I was in 2nd year of Bachelor, I wrote more articles about Data Structures and Algorithms, and little things I found to be fancy about pentesting. After a year of self teaching and research, I&amp;rsquo;m now focusing more on reverse engineering, malware analysis and using data science for faster analysis. There are so many things that I want to know better, but I struggle because they are undocumented, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to retake this. This blog is mainly for my own tracking but I hope it&amp;rsquo;s helpful for others and that I will update this more often!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old blog is still stored at the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/RoundofThree/roundofthree.github.io/tree/master&#34;&gt;RoundofThree/roundofthree.github.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
